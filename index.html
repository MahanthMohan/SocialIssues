            <h3>About the Issue</h3>
            <p class="font-italic">
              One such country, India, has the most number of unfair labor practices despite its growth over the past 70 years since independence
            </p>
            <ul>
              <p>Many daily wage workers in India are clearly underpaid, way below what they are supposed to be paid if the Indian labor laws were in effect. Mr Kumar is one such construction worker who doesn’t know what he may get each day, his wage sometimes dropping to $4 per hour compared to the $7 wage he gets on average. He has to send half of his earnings to his family, which leaves him with no money for himself. There are a lot of hazards in his job, such as getting hit by a brick or falling off the hanging rope while plastering the building with cement, for which he has not been provided any protection. If he dies, then his whole family will be forced to do the same job, including his children. The Indian govt. had passed labor laws which had literally no effect because most businesses chose to remain unorganized as they are nowhere compliant with the governmental regulations. The party that newly came to power seeked to change this and promised that it was going to provide more jobs for people, and decrease unemployment for which it has introduced new laws that make sure that workers are not sacked without a valid reason. The minimum wage was also increased to $2.50 as the standard for all workers. But these reforms have minimal impact, as the unemployment rate has been steadily increasing to a 45 year high of 8.1% and 45% of people in the formal sector are underpaid. But yet, there are problems as mining workers who work on soft soil earn significantly less money than workers who work with hard rocks, which causes many hurdles to implementing these laws. There are still a lot of people, and less jobs available which means that it is easier to be sacked even for small worker demands, as Rohit Singh says. On the other hand, even businesses are being harassed by the police, who demand bribes in exchange for being left alone. In conclusion, the author tries to establish a connection to all these issues in the light that we may be able to actually make a difference to this situation.</p>

          <h2>Causes and Conclusion</h2>
          <p>The paragraph begins by introducing discrimination and unfair treatment of Indians by other Indians in the IT workplace. The article is based on opinions from Quora and other sources, to best reflect public opinion. It shows that the caste system is still practiced even in the US, where there is a huge imbalance of Indians from particular areas compared to the others. Americans and other races consider all Indians to be the same, and this is how it should be except for customs and religion. But the caste system is still practiced, and people of “inferior” face a lot of obstacles. This is an exact copy of the situation in India, with no virtual difference. Indian managers specifically look forward to hiring Indian people in the US because they do not complain even when they are overworked, whereas white people realize that they are being exploited and tend to leave the job. The author also lists outsourcing companies like Cognizant, Infosys, and others that exploit Indians and have got into many cases as per the US labor laws, but then paid their way out like they would in India. The following lines describe how Indians are trained to think that bonded labor is normal and there is nothing to be afraid of, and the level of corruption in Indian govt that continues to this day. It also describes the economic divide between the rich and the poor. Indians are expected to do anything to get a job in foreign countries, as the grass is always greener on the other side even if they take huge salary cuts. This fuels a culture that focuses on bonded labor across the globe, than creating a culture that is mutually beneficial for both the employer and the employee because the situation in India is almost impossible to change. With that said, the author concludes by saying that everyone must join hands to stop this from happening, and that we should create an environment where everyone is happy to do what they like, and not work more than what is required</p>

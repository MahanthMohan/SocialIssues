            <h3>About the Issue</h3>
            <p class="font-italic">
              One such country, India, has the most number of unfair labor practices despite its growth over the past 70 years since independence
            </p>
            <ul>
              <p>People who work should be respected to some extent regardless of what job they do. But this is not always the case, as we can see from the daily wage laborers and IT workers in India. Everything that employers do is to reduce and keep cutting costs until the point when the employer has no regard for the employee’s concerns. Faced with low wages and highly overworked, many are leading miserable lives and with no solution even in the distant future. Even more alarming is the child labor problem, which seems inevitable because of the labor issues that exist in India. Children typically go to work around 7 years old up until the rest of their lives, working under harsh and unsanitary conditions. Here, life risks do not seem significant where there is no money in your pocket. This can be traced back to the labor practices, which says it is okay to underpay workers and extract as much “juice” out of them.  
                The people affected by this issue are the daily wage laborers as well as IT workers who are overworked by their employers with no sufficient compensation. This mostly happens in India, therefore Indians are the most affected.
                This issue originated during the time the British colonized India (around 1750). They created an economy where the local people had to give them what they wanted, or else they would be subjected to severe consequences, including death. Many farmers had to stop growing rice and wheat, and they had to start growing cash crops like indigo, and cotton which were woven into textiles in the mills of Manchester and sold in the Indian markets itself. This caused severe poverty and famines that killed a lot of people, and a change in the people’s mindsets that they can be forced to work under the harshest of conditions, and it would still be acceptable. Therefore, the trend has continued until this day where people are still being overexploited by their employers, and do not realize that they are being overexploited, and this does not just affect daily wage workers but also the IT industry. In conclusion, colonialism has been completely responsible for this issue
                This issue is taking place in developing countries like India, China, and other underdeveloped countries in Africa. But I plan to focus on India because the scale of this issue is enormous to be covered in one article. Also, I would like to target the most affected country, India, which has the highest number of labor issues. If this issue is fixed in India, I think it would be fairly easy for the rest of the world to be corrected.
                This is happening because most laws in India are mostly non-stringent, and even if they are stringent, it is relatively easy to “pay your way” out of the issue. The new laws enacted look like they are fixing the issue, but in reality they make no difference and the people affected by the issue remain affected and not compensated at all. Infact, adding salt to the already existing wounds is the Indian judicial and the police system, which is designed in such a way that it can “extract” the most from the people</p>

          <h2>Causes and Conclusion</h2>
          <p>The paragraph begins by introducing discrimination and unfair treatment of Indians by other Indians in the IT workplace. The article is based on opinions from Quora and other sources, to best reflect public opinion. It shows that the caste system is still practiced even in the US, where there is a huge imbalance of Indians from particular areas compared to the others. Americans and other races consider all Indians to be the same, and this is how it should be except for customs and religion. But the caste system is still practiced, and people of “inferior” face a lot of obstacles. This is an exact copy of the situation in India, with no virtual difference. Indian managers specifically look forward to hiring Indian people in the US because they do not complain even when they are overworked, whereas white people realize that they are being exploited and tend to leave the job. The author also lists outsourcing companies like Cognizant, Infosys, and others that exploit Indians and have got into many cases as per the US labor laws, but then paid their way out like they would in India. The following lines describe how Indians are trained to think that bonded labor is normal and there is nothing to be afraid of, and the level of corruption in Indian govt that continues to this day. It also describes the economic divide between the rich and the poor. Indians are expected to do anything to get a job in foreign countries, as the grass is always greener on the other side even if they take huge salary cuts. This fuels a culture that focuses on bonded labor across the globe, than creating a culture that is mutually beneficial for both the employer and the employee because the situation in India is almost impossible to change. With that said, the author concludes by saying that everyone must join hands to stop this from happening, and that we should create an environment where everyone is happy to do what they like, and not work more than what is required</p>

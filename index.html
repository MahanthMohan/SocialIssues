            <h3>About the Issue</h3>
            <p class="font-italic">
              One such country, India, has the most number of unfair labor practices despite its growth over the past 70 years since independence
            </p>
            <ul>
              <p>
                <h6>What is the issue about?</h6>
                <p>People who work should be respected to some extent regardless of what job they do. But this is not always the case, as we can see from the daily wage laborers and IT workers in India. Everything that employers do is to reduce and keep cutting costs until the point when the employer has no regard for the employee’s concerns. Faced with very low wages and highly overworked, many are leading miserable lives and with no solutions visible even in the distant future. Even more alarming is the child labor problem, which seems inevitable because of the labor issues that exist in India. Children typically go to work around 7 years old up until the rest of their lives, working under harsh and unsanitary conditions. Here, life risks do not seem significant when there is no money in your pocket. This can be traced back to the labor practices, which says it is okay to underpay workers and extract as much “juice” out of them</p>
                <h6>Who are the people affected?</h6>
                <p>The people affected by this issue are the daily wage laborers as well as IT workers who are overworked by their employers with no sufficient compensation. This mostly happens in India, therefore Indians are the most affected.</p>
                <h6>Where is this even happening?</h6>
                <p>This issue is taking place in developing countries like India, China, and other underdeveloped countries in Africa, but those countries have realized there is a problem while India doesn’t even know or care that the issue exists. This is why I plan to focus on India because the scale of this issue is global, which makes it enormous to be covered in one article and because it is better to focus on the most affected country. If this issue is fixed in India, then I think it would be fairly easy for the rest of the world to be corrected</p>
                <h6>Why is this even happening?</h6>
                <p>This is happening because most laws in India are mostly non-stringent, and even if they are stringent, it is relatively easy to “pay your way” out of the issue. The new laws enacted look like they are fixing the issue, but in reality they make no difference and the people affected by the issue remain affected and not compensated at all. Infact, adding salt to the already existing wounds is the Indian judicial and the police system, which is designed in such a way that it can “extract” the most from the people. Therefore, considering all the resulting problems, this issue needs to be brought to public attention and fixed as soon as possible

            <li>The story begins when explorers turned imperialistic when they wanted more of what the land had to offer them, as we can see in the 17th century when the idea of Social Darwinism spread across the globe. They sought to “civilize” the local people just because they did not understand their ways, and because of the fact that they were very different from Western cultures</li>
            <li>Therefore, they played the local people against each other and took control over most parts of the country by the 1800’s. The crops that were forced to be grown were cash crops like Cotton, Coffee, Indigo and others which couldn’t be eaten and were rather used for dying clothes or making beverages. Crops that were essential for life were not allowed to be grown, which led to many famines and caused a lot of deaths. Not having an option, they were either executed or they died of acute starvation. This continued for another century, and slowly harsh labor was considered a very essential skill without which one cannot survive</li>
            <li> The idea of poverty began to strike people’s minds more than the benefits that education offered. Fast forwarding to the 1980’s and the early 90’s, only the richest of the population could dream of making a phone call</li>
            <li>To picture the level of poverty, a poor family of 3 - 5 people can easily manage with just $2.5 each day. Just giving an extra quarter will change their lives forever, and giving them some respect will keep them happy doing what they do. A change is definitely required and if there is a right moment that must arrive, it is right now</li>

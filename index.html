            <h3>About the Issue</h3>
            <p class="font-italic">
              One such country, India, has the most number of unfair labor practices despite its growth over the past 70 years since independence
            </p>
            <ul>
              <p>
                <p>People who work should be respected to some extent regardless of what job they do. But this is not always the case, as we can see from the daily wage laborers and IT workers in India. Everything that employers do is to reduce and keep cutting costs until the point when the employer has no regard for the employee’s concerns. Faced with very low wages and highly overworked, many are leading miserable lives and with no solutions visible even in the distant future. Even more alarming is the child labor problem, which seems inevitable because of the labor issues that exist in India. Children typically go to work around 7 years old up until the rest of their lives, working under harsh and unsanitary conditions. Here, life risks do not seem significant when there is no money in your pocket. This can be traced back to the labor practices, which says it is okay to underpay workers and extract as much “juice” out of them</p>
                <p>The people affected by this issue are the daily wage laborers as well as IT workers who are overworked by their employers with no sufficient compensation. This mostly happens in India, therefore Indians are the most affected.</p>
                <p>This issue originated during the time the British colonized India (around 1750). They created an economy where the local people had to give them what they wanted, or else they would be subjected to severe consequences, including death. Many farmers had to stop growing rice and wheat, and they had to start growing cash crops like indigo, and cotton which were woven into textiles in the mills of Manchester and sold in the Indian markets itself. This caused severe poverty and famines that killed a lot of people, and a change in the people’s mindsets that they can be forced to work under the harshest of conditions, and it would still be acceptable. Therefore, the trend has continued until this day where people are still being overexploited by their employers, and do not realize that they are being overexploited, and this does not just affect daily wage workers but also the IT industry. In conclusion, colonialism has been completely responsible for this issue</p>
                <p>This issue is taking place in developing countries like India, China, and other underdeveloped countries in Africa, but those countries have realized there is a problem while India doesn’t even know or care that the issue exists. This is why I plan to focus on India because the scale of this issue is global, which makes it enormous to be covered in one article and because it is better to focus on the most affected country. If this issue is fixed in India, then I think it would be fairly easy for the rest of the world to be corrected</p>
                <p>This is happening because most laws in India are mostly non-stringent, and even if they are stringent, it is relatively easy to “pay your way” out of the issue. The new laws enacted look like they are fixing the issue, but in reality they make no difference and the people affected by the issue remain affected and not compensated at all. Infact, adding salt to the already existing wounds is the Indian judicial and the police system, which is designed in such a way that it can “extract” the most from the people. Therefore, considering all the resulting problems, this issue needs to be brought to public attention and fixed as soon as possible

          <br>
          <p>Rahul Singh describes the problems caused by this injustice, and helps alarm the readers that this is a significant issue that needs to be fixed as soon as possible. Rather than introducing the issue like yet another article, he brings in an element of pathos or “human touch” to the issue to help the reader connect to the issue not just from a logical standpoint, but also emotionally.</p>

          <p>The story begins during the 1600’s, when many explorers from Europe sailed to various parts of the world to find sea routes to different places, as we see explorers like Columbus land on America when he actually wanted to find India. After some time, they found sea routes to these countries and began trading with them. These good intentions eventually turned imperialistic when they wanted more of what the land had to offer them, as we can see in the 17th century when the idea of Social Darwinism spread across the globe. They sought to “civilize” the local people just because they did not understand their ways, and because of the fact that they were very different from Western cultures. At the same time, the situation in India was ripe for them to colonize it because the Mughal Empire just collapsed around the same time this idea spread. So they played the local people against each other and took control over most parts of the country by the 1800’s. Over the years, they exploited the farmers so much that they were either hanged from trees or blown off a cannon if they refused to grow what they were told. These crops grown were usually cash crops like Cotton, Coffee, Indigo and others which couldn’t be eaten and were rather used for dying clothes or making beverages. Anything else that was essential for the daily diet was not allowed to be grown, which led to many famines and poisoned the land. The farmers who originally held the land were forced to meet their daily “quotas”, without which they would face severe consequences. Not having an option, they were either executed or they died of acute starvation. This continued for another century, and slowly harsh labor was considered a very essential skill without which one cannot survive. The standards for workers only lowered after the Partition of India and Pakistan and the employer expectations only went up higher and higher. The country became poorer and poorer to the extent that even children were sent to work instead of school, because it was thought of as expensive and unnecessary. The idea of Poverty struck people’s minds more than the benefits that education offered. Fast forwarding to the 1980’s and the early 90’s, only the richest of the population could dream of making a phone call. Right from the start, this crisis has only taken turn for the worse and now is the moment when things are getting out of control. In 2010, a survey conducted by the Labor department of India found that close to 28% of children were employed, and manual scavenging was still practiced. Adding to this fact, they also found out that the minimum wage laws were hardly followed and people were paid way lesser than what they had to be paid. To picture the level of poverty, a poor family of 3 - 5 people can easily manage with just $2.5 each day. This is not because they are happy doing it, but because they are not able to even earn the minimum wage. Just giving an extra quarter will change their lives forever, and giving them some respect will keep them happy doing what they do. A change is definitely required and if there is a right moment that must arrive, it is right now</p>

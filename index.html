            <h3>About the Issue</h3>
            <p class="font-italic">
              One such country, India, has the most number of unfair labor practices despite its growth over the past 70 years since independence
            </p>
            <ul>
              <p>
                <p>People who work should be respected to some extent regardless of what job they do. But this is not always the case, as we can see from the daily wage laborers and IT workers in India. Everything that employers do is to reduce and keep cutting costs until the point when the employer has no regard for the employee’s concerns. Faced with very low wages and highly overworked, many are leading miserable lives and with no solutions visible even in the distant future. Even more alarming is the child labor problem, which seems inevitable because of the labor issues that exist in India. Children typically go to work around 7 years old up until the rest of their lives, working under harsh and unsanitary conditions. Here, life risks do not seem significant when there is no money in your pocket. This can be traced back to the labor practices, which says it is okay to underpay workers and extract as much “juice” out of them</p>
                <p>The people affected by this issue are the daily wage laborers as well as IT workers who are overworked by their employers with no sufficient compensation. This mostly happens in India, therefore Indians are the most affected.</p>
                <p>This issue originated during the time the British colonized India (around 1750). They created an economy where the local people had to give them what they wanted, or else they would be subjected to severe consequences, including death. Many farmers had to stop growing rice and wheat, and they had to start growing cash crops like indigo, and cotton which were woven into textiles in the mills of Manchester and sold in the Indian markets itself. This caused severe poverty and famines that killed a lot of people, and a change in the people’s mindsets that they can be forced to work under the harshest of conditions, and it would still be acceptable. Therefore, the trend has continued until this day where people are still being overexploited by their employers, and do not realize that they are being overexploited, and this does not just affect daily wage workers but also the IT industry. In conclusion, colonialism has been completely responsible for this issue</p>
                <p>This issue is taking place in developing countries like India, China, and other underdeveloped countries in Africa, but those countries have realized there is a problem while India doesn’t even know or care that the issue exists. This is why I plan to focus on India because the scale of this issue is global, which makes it enormous to be covered in one article and because it is better to focus on the most affected country. If this issue is fixed in India, then I think it would be fairly easy for the rest of the world to be corrected</p>
                <p>This is happening because most laws in India are mostly non-stringent, and even if they are stringent, it is relatively easy to “pay your way” out of the issue. The new laws enacted look like they are fixing the issue, but in reality they make no difference and the people affected by the issue remain affected and not compensated at all. Infact, adding salt to the already existing wounds is the Indian judicial and the police system, which is designed in such a way that it can “extract” the most from the people. Therefore, considering all the resulting problems, this issue needs to be brought to public attention and fixed as soon as possible

          <p>Rahul Singh describes the problems caused by this injustice, and helps alarm the readers that this is a significant issue that needs to be fixed as soon as possible. Rather than introducing the issue like yet another article, he brings in an element of pathos or “human touch” to the issue to help the reader connect to the issue not just from a logical standpoint, but also emotionally.</p>

          <p>The story begins during the 1600’s, when many explorers from Europe sailed to various parts of the world to find sea routes to different places, as we see explorers like Columbus land on America when he actually wanted to find India. After some time, they found sea routes to these countries and began trading with them. These good intentions eventually turned imperialistic when they wanted more of what the land had to offer them, as we can see in the 17th century when the idea of Social Darwinism spread across the globe. They sought to “civilize” the local people just because they did not understand their ways, and because of the fact that they were very different from Western cultures. At the same time, the situation in India was ripe for them to colonize it because the Mughal Empire just collapsed around the same time this idea spread. So they played the local people against each other and took control over most parts of the country by the 1800’s. Over the years, they exploited the farmers so much that they were either hanged from trees or blown off a cannon if they refused to grow what they were told. These crops grown were usually cash crops like Cotton, Coffee, Indigo and others which couldn’t be eaten and were rather used for dying clothes or making beverages. Anything else that was essential for the daily diet was not allowed to be grown, which led to many famines and poisoned the land. The farmers who originally held the land were forced to meet their daily “quotas”, without which they would face severe consequences. Not having an option, they were either executed or they died of acute starvation. This continued for another century, and slowly harsh labor was considered a very essential skill without which one cannot survive. The standards for workers only lowered after the Partition of India and Pakistan and the employer expectations only went up higher and higher. The country became poorer and poorer to the extent that even children were sent to work instead of school, because it was thought of as expensive and unnecessary. The idea of Poverty struck people’s minds more than the benefits that education offered. Fast forwarding to the 1980’s and the early 90’s, only the richest of the population could dream of making a phone call. Right from the start, this crisis has only taken turn for the worse and now is the moment when things are getting out of control. In 2010, a survey conducted by the Labor department of India found that close to 28% of children were employed, and manual scavenging was still practiced. Adding to this fact, they also found out that the minimum wage laws were hardly followed and people were paid way lesser than what they had to be paid. To picture the level of poverty, a poor family of 3 - 5 people can easily manage with just $2.5 each day. This is not because they are happy doing it, but because they are not able to even earn the minimum wage. Just giving an extra quarter will change their lives forever, and giving them some respect will keep them happy doing what they do. A change is definitely required and if there is a right moment that must arrive, it is right now</p>

          <h5><b>The countless labor issues that have plagued India for the past two centuries can only be fixed by changing existing labor laws and adopting key aspects of labor laws followed in other countries</b></h5>
          <br>
          <p><i>The current labor laws in India are very ineffective as they do not improve the daily lives of the people who are treated unfairly</i></p>
          <br>
          <p>Taking a look at the workforce, we can see that many Indians are heavily overworked. The laws that have been recently passed to fix this issue are hardly effective because there are no consequences for breaking these laws. Employers continue to break the rules with no remorse, and the employees continue to accept it and thus the whole system goes wrong. The laws seem to be getting better because of the increased efforts and attention from the UN, but these reforms just look good on paper and are not implementable practically. For example, one such article on labor reforms states that people are not paid what they are supposed to be paid, not even the minimum wages. On top of this, the police collect bribes from local businesses and make sure that the workers do not revolt or form unions to bring changes. The author finally adds that almost 90% of people are employed in the informal sector (Al Jazeera, Labor Reforms). This clearly shows that the impact of these laws are only felt in some places, whereas the biggest place (the informal sector) is pushed aside. If it is such a niche part of the economy that it targets, why pass those laws that do not make any difference? When the police itself is collecting bribes instead of administering justice, how can the laws be successfully implemented? Such questions are clearly answerable, but the point of the government, the businesses, and the police is to suppress those opinions and try to force theirs upon them. This way they can extract the most benefits from their work, and make it as profitable as possible for themselves. If they were to implement these reforms sincerely, they cannot get the extra benefits that they used to get when they underpaid the workers and cannot pay bribes to the police for suppressing their opinions. This way, the whole system changes for the good and this is not what they want for themselves. Once profits are not the only motive of a business, and the welfare of the employees and the customers are taken into account will the current condition change for the better</p>
          <br>
          <p><i>Economic disparity between the rich and the poor has widened in recent times and can only be abridged by enacting laws that enforce minimum wage and prevent child labor</i></p>
          <br>
          <p>The only country where you can truly experience the feeling of being rich and poor at the same place, and at the same time is India. This has only grown more and more since Independence , and the divide has only kept worsening in recent times. This has caused the poor to find ways to improve their situation in any way they can. One such way is to stop the education of children, and send them to work so that they can earn some money for the family. According to an article on child labor, almost 60% of families are so poor and earn so less that they cannot afford to even take care of having a meal one time a day (Washington Post, Child Labor and the Judicial System). Considering this kind of situation, how can they even think of sending kids to school? Unlike the US, government schools are extremely bad and everyone prefers to send their kids to private schools which cost almost $300/year at minimum. Such a privilege cannot be expected, but the problem of sending kids to school can be solved if employers pay the workers the minimum wage that they deserve for their work. For instance, under the new laws, a worker who breaks hard rocks earns more than the worker who works with soft materials like cement (Al Jazeera, Labor Reforms). Although this is a very good idea to pay workers based on the difficulty of their work, it is hardly implemented as every worker, regardless of the difficulty of their work, is actually underpaid. If they usually earn $3/day under the minimum wage, they are paid $1.5/day when they’re underpaid (Wikipedia, Minimum Wage). Yet the same amount of work with the same quality is expected, as they may be fired or verbally abused if they don’t meet the requirements. Setting up labor unions usually results in harsh consequences such as not being able to work elsewhere. Only when they are rightfully paid for their work, and respected will the child labor problem be solved. If they are not even able to eat, how will the thought of education capture their minds? This is why the children themselves prefer to go to work to earn whatever the meagre salary they may be paid. In summary, if maximizing profits are the only concern, then the very essence of humanity is pushed aside</p>
          <br>
          <p><i>Everyone must be given respect regardless of their occupation/livelihood to encourage job satisfaction and inhumane practices such as manual scavenging should be eradicated</i></p>

              <h5><b>The countless labor issues that have plagued India for the past two centuries can only be fixed by changing existing labor laws and adopting key aspects of labor laws followed in other countries</b></h5>
              <br>
              <p><i>The current labor laws in India are very ineffective as they do not improve the daily lives of the people who are treated unfairly</i></p>
              <br>
              <p>Taking a look at the workforce, we can see that many Indians are heavily overworked. The laws that have been recently passed to fix this issue are hardly effective because there are no consequences for breaking these laws. Employers continue to break the rules with no remorse, and the employees continue to accept it and thus the whole system goes wrong. The laws seem to be getting better because of the increased efforts and attention from the UN, but these reforms just look good on paper and are not implementable practically. For example, one such article on labor reforms states that people are not paid what they are supposed to be paid, not even the minimum wages. On top of this, the police collect bribes from local businesses and make sure that the workers do not revolt or form unions to bring changes. The author finally adds that almost 90% of people are employed in the informal sector (Al Jazeera, Labor Reforms). This clearly shows that the impact of these laws are only felt in some places, whereas the biggest place (the informal sector) is pushed aside. If it is such a niche part of the economy that it targets, why pass those laws that do not make any difference? When the police itself is collecting bribes instead of administering justice, how can the laws be successfully implemented? Such questions are clearly answerable, but the point of the government, the businesses, and the police is to suppress those opinions and try to force theirs upon them. This way they can extract the most benefits from their work, and make it as profitable as possible for themselves. If they were to implement these reforms sincerely, they cannot get the extra benefits that they used to get when they underpaid the workers and cannot pay bribes to the police for suppressing their opinions. This way, the whole system changes for the good and this is not what they want for themselves. Once profits are not the only motive of a business, and the welfare of the employees and the customers are taken into account will the current condition change for the better</p>

              <p><i>Economic disparity between the rich and the poor has widened in recent times and can only be abridged by enacting laws that enforce minimum wage and prevent child labor</i></p>
              <br>
              <p>The only country where you can truly experience the feeling of being rich and poor at the same place, and at the same time is India. This has only grown more and more since Independence , and the divide has only kept worsening in recent times. This has caused the poor to find ways to improve their situation in any way they can. One such way is to stop the education of children, and send them to work so that they can earn some money for the family. According to an article on child labor, almost 60% of families are so poor and earn so less that they cannot afford to even take care of having a meal one time a day (Washington Post, Child Labor and the Judicial System). Considering this kind of situation, how can they even think of sending kids to school? Unlike the US, government schools in India are extremely bad and everyone prefers to send their kids to private schools which cost almost $300/year at minimum. Such a privilege cannot be expected, but the problem of sending kids to school can be solved if employers pay the workers the minimum wage that they deserve for their work. For instance, under the new laws, a worker who breaks hard rocks earns more than the worker who works with soft materials like cement (Al Jazeera, Labor Reforms). Although this is a very good idea to pay workers based on the difficulty of their work, it is hardly implemented as every worker, regardless of the difficulty of their work, is actually underpaid. If they usually earn $3/day under the minimum wage, they are paid $2/day (Wikipedia, Minimum Wage). Yet the same amount of work with the same quality is expected, as they may be fired or verbally abused if they don’t meet the requirements. Setting up labor unions usually results in harsh consequences such as not being able to work elsewhere. Only when they are rightfully paid for their work, and respected will the child labor problem be solved. If they are not even able to eat, how will the thought of education capture their minds? This is why the children themselves prefer to go to work to earn whatever the meagre salary they may be paid. In summary, if maximizing profits are the only concern, then the very essence of humanity is pushed aside</p>

              <p><i>Everyone must be given respect regardless of their occupation/livelihood to encourage job satisfaction and inhumane practices such as manual scavenging should be eradicated</i></p>
              <br>
              <p>Manual scavenging is another issue that has been a big problem. Despite the harsh and inhumane nature of the job, and even after many were killed, this continues to this day. We can trace this back to the caste system, which led people to believe that some castes were inferior and that they could only do certain jobs and this was one of them. Any job, no matter what it is about, should be given the same amount of respect as any other job in the society. Everyone has something to offer to the society on their part, and no one’s role is smaller or larger in the society. For example, we can see garbage collectors who clean the pavements to keep it clean here in the US, and we respect them like we would any other job although it is not something we want to do. That makes them feel appreciated and valued, and keeps them happy without regretting taking up the job. In India, the garbage collectors are insulted, paid very less, and the job is thought of as very unhygienic and useless although it plays a major role by keepings the surrounding clean. This judgemental attitude needs to be changed, and laws that eradicate manual scavenging should be passed. According to an article of Labor Reforms, the Government of India passed multiple laws banning the practice in 1993, and a couple more in 2013 to add onto the existing ones (Reuters, Law Report). The author of the article says that although the laws were passed, it is of no use even now because it has not been followed or implemented. Only when these laws are not only passed, but also enforced through the help of police and Human Rights organization will people be respected and inhumane practices like manual scavenging be eradicated. Thus, in conclusion, the next steps must be taken in ensuring that these laws are followed and automatically when one changes, the other does, and that creates a sweeping change through the population.</p>

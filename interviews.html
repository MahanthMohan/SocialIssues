              <h5>Interview with Rahul Singh, an Affected person</h5>
              <br>
              <h6>Q: Who is the interviewee?</h6>
              <p>A: Rahul Singh is a daily wage laborer at a construction site, and he is verbally abused and threatened to do more work. He is paid way below the minimum wage, although he does a lot of hard work like breaking stones and cementing the bricks. His family is not able to sustain with his income, and therefore plan on sending their children to work, and discontinuing their education</p>
              <br>
              <h6>Q: What’s the problem that he faces everyday?</h6>
              <p>A: He is continually threatened to be fired from his job, and is told by his employer that once he is fired he wouldn’t be able to find work elsewhere. He is accused of doing less and coming late to work even though he does his work diligently. He is only paid $1.25 each day and when he asked for a raise, he was told by his employer that if he was good enough he wouldn’t be here. He cements the sides of a 100 ft building while hanging on a thin rope, with no protective net below. If he falls then he dies, and then his whole family would have to go to work. The sight of his whole family going to work hurts him more than the fact that he may die anytime</p>
              <br>
              <h6>Q: What is his view about the issue?</h6>
              <p>A: Rahul feels that the issue has grown so big that it is hard to find a solution anytime soon. He recalls that for the past 25 years that he has been going to work, he has always been treated the same way. He wants to be paid the minimum wage of $3 each day so that his family will have just enough money to buy food to eat, and his children can go to school. But when asked about the issue itself, he says it is part of the work culture and never going to change anytime in the next 200 years. He says the government, the employer, and the police work work together to violently put down his and others’ opinion about the way they are treated</p>
              <br>
              <h6>Q: How does he think that the issue can be solved?</h6>
              <p>A: He thinks that the issue can only be solved if people change their general opinion of minimum wage workers and feels that every political party aims to make the most out of the people, collect bribes from employers in exchange for reckless exploitation of workers like him. When he wanted to vote, he was not able to find one person who would be the perfect candidate for bringing in these reforms. Yet he still has hope in himself, as he says the only way out is to form extremely large unions to peacefully protest against the exploitative policies of the employers and the government, and make them realize what they do is wrong. Once there are no workers, the economy comes to a standstill, and they have no way out but to make those reforms. He concludes by saying that if this turns out to be a success, every worker across the country can live a happy, contented life</p>

                <h5>Interview with Rohan Patel, an Activist</h5>
                <br>
                <h6>Q: Who is the interviewee?</h6>
                <p>A: Rohan Patel has been affected by/realized the impact of the injustice and is actively trying to fix the issue. He set up his own organization 7 years ago to address this issue. This shows that he is deeply concerned about this issue, and will offer a non-biased detailed perspective on how the issue came to be, is impacting people, and can be fixed</p>
                <br>
                <h6>Q: How does he feel about the issue?</h6>
                <p>A: Rohan feels that this issue has been around for a long time, and it is only now that it has grown so much. Employers are always looking for every opportunity to squeeze out more profits in any which way they can, even if it means overexploitation of workers, he says. His views on the current laws are that they are able to cover every aspect of injustice, but not really enforced as he himself saw a case where the factory owner paid bribes to the police to suppress the workers’ protests</p>
                <br>
                <h6>Q: What are the problems?</h6>
                <p>A: Rohan says one of the major problems is that a lot of people cannot earn enough to support their basic needs like food, shelter, etc and are also forced to work beyond the point until which they can tolerate, leading to many physical and psychological issues. They neither have the money nor the privilege to undergo psychological treatment, as it is far beyond their reach. Some are unable to spend time with their children and even send their children to work, others have multiple life changing accidents, but they are all forced to go to the same job that neither shows them any respect nor does it pay them even a meagre salary enough to sustain life. </p>
                <br>
                <h6>Q: How does he think it can be fixed?</h6>
                <p>A: It can be solved by educating the population about labor issues, and changing the system so that there are severe consequences if the labor laws are not followed. Any act of concealing people and making them work overtime for low wages must be dealt with even more severity. Applicable aspects from labor laws in other countries such as the United states, Australia, and the UK should be passed and enforced as necessary. Workers must be allowed to organize labor unions if there is a real need, to vent out their problems and get them addressed. Dignity of labor should be not limited to not just blue collared jobs, but also white collared jobs. This, Rohan thinks, will truly change how people live their lives and will definitely help in solving this issue</p>
